Disadvantages of Layering:
1. Duplication of Work: Some functions (e.g., error handling) repeated in layers
2. Inefficiency/Overhead: Each layer adds headers, increasing data size
3. Dependency: Higher layers depend on lower layers, failure affects all
4. Complexity: Implementation and maintenance of multiple layers is complex
5. Not Always Optimal: Strict layering rules may reduce efficiency in real systems
