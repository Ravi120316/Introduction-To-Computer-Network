Concept of Layering:
- Network divided into layers, each layer has specific task
- Makes design, troubleshooting and improvement easier

Layering Example (Post Office):
1. Application Layer: Writing the letter
2. Transport Layer: Packing the letter
3. Network Layer: Routing to correct city/state
4. Data Link / Physical Layer: Actual delivery via transport
