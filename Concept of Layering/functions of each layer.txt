# Functions of Each OSI Layer

## 1. Physical Layer
- Deals with the physical transmission of raw bits (0s and 1s).
- Defines cables, switches, signals, and hardware devices.
- Ensures how data is transmitted over physical media (wired or wireless).

## 2. Data Link Layer
- Provides error detection and correction for directly connected nodes.
- Uses **MAC addresses** for device-to-device communication.
- Responsible for framing and flow control.
- Devices: Switches, Bridges.

## 3. Network Layer
- Responsible for **logical addressing and routing**.
- Uses **IP addresses** to deliver packets from source to destination across networks.
- Ensures correct path selection.
- Device: Router.

## 4. Transport Layer
- Ensures **reliable and error-free end-to-end delivery** of data.
- Handles segmentation, sequencing, and flow control.
- Protocols: TCP (reliable), UDP (fast but less reliable).

## 5. Session Layer
- Establishes, manages, and terminates sessions between applications.
- Provides synchronization and dialog control.

## 6. Presentation Layer
- Translates data between application and network formats.
- Handles **encryption, decryption, compression, and encoding**.
- Example: Data encryption in secure transactions (SSL/TLS).

## 7. Application Layer
- Closest to the user; provides network services to applications.
- Protocols: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, etc.
- Examples: Web browsing, email, file transfer.
