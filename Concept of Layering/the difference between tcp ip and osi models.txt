# Difference Between OSI and TCP/IP Models

| Aspect                | OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)             | TCP/IP Model (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Full Form**         | Open Systems Interconnection                        | Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol             |
| **Developed By**      | ISO (International Standards Organization)          | DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, USA)        |
| **Layers**            | 7 layers (Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical) | 4 layers (Application, Transport, Internet, Network Access)   |
| **Concept**           | Theoretical model, used for understanding and standardization | Practical model, used in real-world networking (Internet)     |
| **Reliability**       | Provides reliable guidelines but not implemented directly | Provides reliable communication (TCP) and fast communication (UDP) |
| **Protocol Dependency** | Protocol independent (general framework)           | Protocol specific (works with TCP, IP, UDP, etc.)             |
| **Usage**             | Used for teaching, reference, and conceptual clarity | Used in actual Internet communication                        |

## Key Points:
- **OSI = Conceptual model (7 layers)**
- **TCP/IP = Practical model (4 layers, real-world use)**
- Internet today works mainly on the **TCP/IP model**.
