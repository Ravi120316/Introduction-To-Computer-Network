Advantages of Layering Mechanism:
1. Simplifies Design: Each layer has specific task, easy to design
2. Easy Troubleshooting: Problems in one layer can be fixed independently
3. Interoperability: Devices from different vendors can communicate
4. Flexibility: Upgrade one layer without affecting others
5. Standardization: Layers define standards, ensuring global compatibility
