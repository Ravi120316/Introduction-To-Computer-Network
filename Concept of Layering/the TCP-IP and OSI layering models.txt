# TCP/IP and OSI Models

## OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)

Definition:
A reference model with 7 layers that defines how data is transmitted from one computer to another over a network.

Purpose:
- Standardization of communication
- Allows devices from different vendors to communicate
- Helps in troubleshooting and understanding network flow

### 7 Layers of OSI Model (Top → Bottom):
1. Application Layer – Provides services to end users (e.g., HTTP, SMTP, FTP)
2. Presentation Layer – Translates, encrypts, compresses data (e.g., SSL/TLS)
3. Session Layer – Manages sessions (e.g., video call session)
4. Transport Layer – Ensures reliable delivery, error checking, sequencing (TCP/UDP)
5. Network Layer – Handles logical addressing & routing (IP, Routers)
6. Data Link Layer – Deals with MAC addresses & error detection (Ethernet, Switches)
7. Physical Layer – Transmits raw bits via cables/wireless (Cables, Wi-Fi, Hubs)

## TCP/IP Model (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol)

Definition:
A practical model used for real-world Internet communication.

Developed by:
U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)

### 4 Layers of TCP/IP Model:
1. Application Layer – Combines OSI’s Application + Presentation + Session (e.g., HTTP, DNS, FTP)
2. Transport Layer – Provides end-to-end communication (TCP for reliability, UDP for speed)
3. Internet Layer – Handles addressing & routing (IP, ICMP)
4. Network Access Layer – Combines Data Link + Physical layers (Ethernet, Wi-Fi)

## Difference Between OSI and TCP/IP Models

| Feature          | OSI Model (7 Layers)              | TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)         |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Developed By     | ISO (International Standards Org.)| DoD (Department of Defense)     |
| Type             | Theoretical (Reference model)     | Practical (Implemented model)   |
| Layers           | 7                                 | 4                               |
| Flexibility      | More detailed, strict             | Flexible, widely used           |
| Use Case         | Used for teaching & understanding | Used in real-world networking   |

Quick Tip:
- OSI Model = Conceptual (7 layers)
- TCP/IP Model = Practical (4 layers)
