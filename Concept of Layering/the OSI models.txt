# The OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)

## Definition:
The OSI Model is a conceptual framework that standardizes how data is transmitted between two devices over a network.  
It divides the communication process into 7 different layers, each with a specific function.

## Purpose of OSI Model:
- Helps understand and design network communication.
- Provides standardization so devices from different vendors can work together.
- Makes troubleshooting easier by isolating problems in specific layers.

## The 7 Layers of OSI Model (Top â†’ Bottom):

1. **Application Layer**
   - Provides services directly to end users.
   - Examples: HTTP (web browsing), SMTP (email), FTP (file transfer).

2. **Presentation Layer**
   - Translates data into a format usable by the application.
   - Handles data encryption, compression, translation.
   - Example: SSL/TLS for secure communication.

3. **Session Layer**
   - Manages sessions between applications.
   - Responsible for starting, maintaining, and ending communication.
   - Example: Managing a video call or login session.

4. **Transport Layer**
   - Ensures reliable delivery of data with error detection and flow control.
   - Provides segmentation and reassembly of data.
   - Protocols: TCP (reliable), UDP (faster but unreliable).

5. **Network Layer**
   - Handles logical addressing and routing of packets.
   - Responsible for determining the best path for data delivery.
   - Examples: IP (IPv4/IPv6), Routers.

6. **Data Link Layer**
   - Provides physical addressing (MAC addresses).
   - Ensures error detection and correction at the link level.
   - Examples: Ethernet, Switches.

7. **Physical Layer**
   - Transmits raw bits (0s and 1s) over the physical medium.
   - Deals with hardware like cables, hubs, radio signals.
   - Examples: Fiber optics, Coaxial cable, Wi-Fi signals.

## Key Points to Remember:
- OSI Model = **Theoretical / Reference model**
- Used for **learning, teaching, and troubleshooting**
- Real-world implementation is mostly based on the **TCP/IP model**
