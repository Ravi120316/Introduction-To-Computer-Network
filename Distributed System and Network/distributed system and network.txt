# Distributed System vs Network

## Network:
- A collection of computers and devices connected together.
- Purpose: To share data and resources (e.g., printer, files).
- Focuses only on connectivity and communication.
- Example: LAN in an office.

## Distributed System:
- Built on top of a network.
- Appears as a **single unified system** to the user, even though multiple computers work together.
- Purpose: Resource sharing, fault tolerance, scalability, parallel processing.
- Users donâ€™t need to know how many computers are involved.
- Example: Google Search, Online Banking Systems, Netflix servers.

## Key Difference:
- **Network** = Just connectivity + data sharing.
- **Distributed System** = Network + unified computing + resource management.
