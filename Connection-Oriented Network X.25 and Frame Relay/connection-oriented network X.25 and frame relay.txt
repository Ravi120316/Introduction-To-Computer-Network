# Connection-Oriented Network: X.25 and Frame Relay

## Connection-Oriented Concept:
- A dedicated logical path is established before data transfer.
- All packets follow the same path.
- Example: Telephone call analogy.

---

## X.25:
- Early packet switching protocol (1970s).
- Provides error correction and flow control at each node.
- Very reliable but slow (high overhead).
- Used in banking networks, ATMs, early WAN systems.

---

## Frame Relay:
- Successor to X.25 (1990s).
- Error checking only at entry/exit points (not at each node).
- Faster, more efficient, lower cost.
- Less reliable compared to X.25.
- Used to connect LANs over WAN (corporate networks, ISPs).

## Key Difference:

| Feature              | X.25                          | Frame Relay                   |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Era                  | 1970s                         | 1990s                         |
| Speed                | Slow                          | Fast                          |
| Reliability          | Very high (error checking at each node) | Moderate (checking only at edges) |
| Overhead             | High                          | Low                           |
| Usage                | Banking, ATMs                 | Corporate WAN, ISP backbone   |
