# Peer-to-Peer vs Client-Server Network

## Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Network:
- No central server; all computers are equal (peers).
- Each peer can act as both client and server.
- Easy to set up, low cost.
- Difficult to manage and less secure.
- Example: Torrent (BitTorrent), small office/lab sharing.

## Client-Server Network:
- One central server provides resources/services.
- Clients request data/services from the server.
- More secure and easier to manage.
- Higher cost and requires professional setup.
- Example: Web servers, Banking systems, Email servers.
